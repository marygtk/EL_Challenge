We have a interface , that describe the funcionally of the test.
We have a objet where we should write the website's title , that element will be who describe the functionality

For example :"dexter"

"dexter":{
       "url":"", // in this field we have to write the url's website
       "login":{ // in this field we describe the login steps
           "xpachClickSearch":[""],// we will build a array of clicks to go the login's page 
           "xpathInputEmail":"", // In this field we will write the email xpath
           "xpathInputPassword":"", // In this field we will write the password xpath
           "email":"",  //In this field we will write the email value
           "password":"", //In this field we will write the password value
           "xpathClick":"", //In this field we will write the button' submit xpath
           "hashExpect":"" // In this field we will write the url we hope
           
       },
       "search":{
            "iconSearch":"", //In this field we will write the icon Search's xpath and then we will go to click it
            "inputSearch":"", //In this field we will write the input Search's xpath and then we will go to type it the value
            "inputValue":"", // In this field we will write the input value
            "sendForm":"", //In this field we will write the button submit's xpath and then we will go to click it
            "expectUrl":"" // In this field we will write the url we hope
        },
        "selectItem":{
            "item":"", // in this feild we will write the common xpath of the all list item for example : "div/ul/li"
            "numbersItem":["[1]","[2]","[3]"] // In this field we will write the complete to the common url, this complements identifies the item we want to go
        },
        "addItems":{
            "clickOnItems":[ ],//In this field we will write a list of the xpaths where we are going to click to add item,
            "cartAccountItems":"" // In this field we will write the xpath where we can find the amount of item in the cart
        },
        "deleteItems":{
            "cart":"" // In this field we will write the cart xpath and then we wiil click it ,
            "item":"", // in this feild we will write the common xpath of the all list item for example : "div/ul/li"
            "clicksToDelete":[// in this feild we will write a list of the objets that describes clicks to delete one items of the cart
                {
                    "deleteIcon":"[3]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/button",
                    "confirmDelete":"//*[@id='removeProductModal']/div/div/div[3]/button[2]",
                    "closeModal":"//*[@id='removeProductModal']/div/div/div[1]/button"
                },
            ],
            "cartAccountItems":"" // In this field we will write the xpath where we can find the amount of item in the cart
        }
    }

    
This would be something appreciated to make an interface or a class that describes a type of object,
in typed languages ​​such as java, of course these functionalities such as typing and interface can be obtained
by configuring typescript in our cypress project. The important thing about this is that you can
 parameterize and reuse functions for similar behavior
