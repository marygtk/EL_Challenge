Pre-screening questions:

1) When would you plan/start automation for a project? What would be your pre-requisites?

Answer: The principal steps to follow will be analyze the documentation provided where the requisits where explained, I would start to write the tests plans/Suite in TestLink
or JIRA. The I would start to setup define the gitflow. Build the repository, and start define the test automation arquitecture.

2) If you have to automate scripts for 2 or more websites that have similar functionality,
what would your automation approach be?

Answer: I would make a reusable code/functions and then the only thing to run the test will be a .json file that that passes the required information on each function.
The Key is to develop reusable code.

3) Define ypur strategy on integration of automation with CI/CD.

5) How would you strategize a release in Agile?
I would use scrum methodologies, I would devide the first steps metioned con the first questions into one sprint that has periods of 1or 2 weeks. I would make User
Histories into the JIRA backlog and create subtasks there. 

6) You are working on a time sensitive project and you realize the quality of the code is not
satisfactory. How would you handle this situation?

Answer: The times of delivery are always very short, so its something to face daily in IT jobs. I would try to read the code,
 try to fix the arquitecture planted for the cases's escenarios, and then evaluate if some 
functions of the application to test can be effectivly automated, 
if the code is very badly builded I would build the whole scripts again.
